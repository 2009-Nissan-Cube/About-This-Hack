# Overview of Features

In the app, there are four tabs on a tab bar at the top of the window, and each one visually presents some information about your system.

The Overview tab presents standard system specifications, such as computer model, OS, processor, etc. The app also shows the Clover or OpenCore bootloader version, if applicable.
